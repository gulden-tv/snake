# snake
This is a small terminal game - Snake built with the ncurses library.

If you want to compile it don't forget to add key -lncurses:

```sh
gcc  main.c -lncurses
```

Small update: you can try hotseat multiplayer game passing -s flag and make loop from the snake (do not crush to other snakes!).
